## Overview
This document provides an overview and explanation of the images uploaded. Each image represents a specific analysis or visualization, grouped by its respective purpose and insights.

---

### 1. **Marketing Mix Model: Ad Stock & Saturation Effect**
- **Description**: This graph illustrates the impact of ad stock and saturation on three different response channels (A, B, and C) over time.
- **Purpose**: To analyze the diminishing returns of ad stock and measure the saturation effect for each channel.
- **Key Insight**: Channels stabilize after an initial growth phase, reflecting saturation effects.

---

### 2. **Ad Stock Effect with Different Decay Factors**
- **Description**: This chart compares the ad stock impact with three different decay rates (0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) over time.
- **Purpose**: To evaluate how different decay factors affect the retention of ad effectiveness.
- **Key Insight**: A higher decay rate (0.7) maintains longer-lasting ad effects, while lower rates diminish faster.

---

### 3. **Saturation Effect with Different Parameters**
- **Description**: This visualization examines the saturation effect on ad performance across different parameter settings.
- **Purpose**: To compare how varying saturation parameters influence campaign effectiveness.
- **Key Insight**: Lower parameter values sustain ad efficiency longer, whereas higher values lead to faster saturation.

---

### 4. **Feature Importances (Bar Chart)**
- **Description**: A bar chart showing feature importance for a model, highlighting key factors influencing customer satisfaction.
- **Purpose**: To identify the most impactful features for model predictions.
- **Key Insight**: "Inflight Wi-Fi Service" is the most influential feature, while features like "Class (Economy)" and "Personal Travel" negatively impact satisfaction.

---

### 5. **Data Preview**
- **Description**: A snapshot of the dataset used for analysis, showing columns like satisfaction, gender, customer type, and various service-related features.
- **Purpose**: To provide a quick reference for dataset structure and variables.
- **Key Insight**: Features include both demographic and service-related data, which influence satisfaction.

---

### 6. **Logistic Regression Coefficients**
- **Description**: Displays the coefficients of a logistic regression model, showing the direction and magnitude of each featureâ€™s impact.
- **Purpose**: To quantify how each feature affects the likelihood of customer satisfaction.
- **Key Insight**: "Inflight Entertainment" and "On-board Service" positively impact satisfaction, while "Disloyal Customers" significantly reduce satisfaction.

---

### 7. **SHAP Feature Importance (Bar Plot)**
- **Description**: A SHAP-based bar chart showing average feature importance in the model.
- **Purpose**: To understand how individual features impact predictions.
- **Key Insight**: "Inflight Entertainment" has the highest positive impact, while "Disloyal Customers" is the most significant negative factor.

---

### 8. **SHAP Summary Dot Plot**
- **Description**: A SHAP-based dot plot showing the distribution of feature impacts on the model output.
- **Purpose**: To visualize both positive and negative contributions of each feature to the predictions.
- **Key Insight**: Features like "Inflight Entertainment" and "Seat Comfort" show high positive contributions for high feature values.

---

### 9. **Q-Learning Convergence: Search Pricing Reinforcement Learning**
- **Description**: A line chart showing total rewards per episode during Q-learning for a search pricing reinforcement learning model.
- **Purpose**: To demonstrate the learning progress and convergence of the model.
- **Key Insight**: The model converges after approximately 400 episodes, indicating an optimal policy is achieved.

---

### 10. **Final Q-Table Heatmap**
- **Description**: A heatmap displaying the final Q-values for combinations of demand levels and pricing strategies.
- **Purpose**: To identify the optimal pricing strategy for different demand levels.
- **Key Insight**: High pricing yields the highest rewards during high demand, while low pricing consistently underperforms.
